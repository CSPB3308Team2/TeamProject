# Project Proposal

### Group: #2

Github Location: https://github.com/CSPB3308Team2/TeamProject

### Team Members:

- William Egesdal
- Madeline Odom
- Dylan Power
- Eugene (Jia) Ei
- Daniel Shackelford

### Vision Statement:

Prioritize tasks based upon how busy the venue is.

### Potential Names:

- Todo Loco

### Motivation:

Save working hours by strategically choosing the least crowded time of day.

### Risks:

1. No prior experience working with this team members
2. User security / data tracking
3. Cost
4. Feature creep / scope
5. Scheduling development
6. Managing roadblocks

### Mitigation Strategy:

1. Communication channels (Telegram, Zoom), Google Drive, Trello/Clubhouse
2. Not build our own authentication system / not store cleartext passwords / hosting on a app service platform that provides an SSL certificate
3. Pick our resources carefully
4. Hold regular Agile meetings to iterate over the feature set / Create persona of who our user is and keep their needs in mind / Review our vision statement at the beginning of our meetings
5. Emphasizing agile sizing at the beginning of the project / Set deadlines, check ins
6. Ensuring that there is a support network for each task / cultivate a community where asking for help is accepted

### Development method:

- Scrum (sprints)
- Kanban (big picture)

##### Web Framework Possibilities:

| Name  | Language   | Pros                                        | Cons                                                      |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flask | Python     | Covered in the course, language familiarity |                                                           |
| React | Javascript | Most APIs are JavaScript native             | Requires understanding node and framework-specific quirks |

##### Database Possibilities:

| Name          | Pros                               | Cons                |

| Local Storage |                                    |                     |
| MongoDb       | Free tier, doc based db(json like) |
| Firestore     | Google,doc based db(json like)     | costs a little bit  |
| SQL           | familiar                           | Harder to work from |
